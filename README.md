# Sound_Polution_Monitoring_System
It's a sound pollution monitoring system to help the traffic.

Introducing a sound pollution monitoring system using Arduino technology. By detecting excessive honking from vehicles, this project utilizes a sound sensor to trigger actions. When noise levels exceed a threshold, a servo motor blocks the road, accompanied by a red signal and LCD display indicating road closure duration and decibel levels. As noise diminishes, the signal turns green, reopening the road. An innovative solution to curb noise pollution and promote road safety.
